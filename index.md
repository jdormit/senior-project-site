# Spark
## A real-time collaborative text editor

*Spark* is a web-based text editor featuring syntax highlighting, a document tree, and other standard code editor features. It allows multiple users to work on the same files in real-time in the style of Google Docs. *Spark* is [Jeremy Dormitzer](http://jeremydormitzer.com)'s senior project. The project is currently in the planning stage.

## User Stories and Sprint Planning
